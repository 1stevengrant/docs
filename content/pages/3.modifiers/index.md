overview: Modifiers give you the ability to manipulate the data of your variables on the fly. They can manipulate strings, filter arrays and lists, help you compare things, do basic math, simplify your markup, and even help you debug.

We've organized the modifiers by type of data they're designed to manipulate or the type of function they perform. Some modifiers (like `shuffle` and `count`) work on multiple data types and will be repeated in more than one section.
