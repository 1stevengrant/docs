# Event Classes

Sometimes it's necessary for the payload in an event to be more complex than a simple string or array of parameters.
In these cases, an event class will be sent along as the payload.

## Statamic\Events\StacheUpdated

This class contains 3 boolean properties: `$content`, `$assets`, and `$users` that state whether the respective caches were
updated.

It also contains a `$stache` property which contains an `Statamic\Contracts\Stache\Cache` object.
