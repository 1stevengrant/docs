## One-click updates {#one-click-updates}

Statamic has a one-click updater in the Control Panel. When an update is available, users with Update permissions will see a badge in the sidebar next to the logo. Clicking on that badge will take you to a magical, bountiful land flowing with updates and releases.

</div>

Once here, all you need to do is click the **Update** button and watch as the work is done for you.

You can get to this section at any time by going to `Tools Â» Updater`. It's possible that you could beat the system and find an update before it makes it to the badge. Just keep refreshing. That's one way to live.

## Manual updates {#manual-updates}

Manually updating is just as simple:

- Download the latest version from [statamic.com](http://statamic.com).
- Replace your `statamic/` folder with the newest one.
- Run `php please clear:cache`.
- Run `php please update:housekeeping` to perform any additional tasks that the updater would have taken care of automatically.
- Run `php please addons:refresh` if you have any addons installed.
