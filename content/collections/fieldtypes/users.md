## Data Structure {#data-structure}

The Users fieldtype is a [Relate fieldtype](/docs/fieldtypes/relate), which means the users will be saved asÂ IDs.

``` .language-yaml
jedis:
  - 892jfsd9a90as
  - 134jk1h78dfas
```

## Templating {#templating}

Use the [Relate tag](/docs/tags/relate) to loop through the IDs and fetch the user data.

```
<ul>
  {{ relate:jedis }}
    <li>{{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}</li>
  {{ /relate:jedis }}
</ul>
```

``` .language-output
<ul>
  <li>Luke Skywalker</li>
  <li>Yoda</li>
</ul>
```
