title: Array
overview: |
  This is used to create a very specific type of YAML data, the `key: value` array. This is different from the Grid/Replicator (Multi-dimensional Array) approach because each key is unique instead of looping through sets of the same fields.
  
  It can provide a cleaner content management experience _and_ cleaner templates when used in the right situation.
