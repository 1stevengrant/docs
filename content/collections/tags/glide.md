## Example {#example}


We have an image's ID saved in the YAML, and we want to resize it to 300x200, fit it inside the area by cropping it, and apply a sepia filter.

``` language-yaml
image: "380dc8d9-481c-4d18-9162-ecd5688f98a8"
```

```
{{ glide src="{image}" width="300" height="200" fit="crop" filter="sepia" }}

<!-- shorthand syntax: -->
{{ glide:image width="300" height="200" fit="crop" filter="sepia" }}
```

``` .language-output
/img/380dc8d9-481c-4d18-9162-ecd5688f98a8?w=300&h=200&fit=crop&filt=sepia&s=3982hf983f2mf90r23
```


## Focal Crop {#focal-crop}

When using the `fit` parameter, you may choose to crop to a focal point. You may specify the
two offset percentages: `crop-x%-y%`.

For example, `fit="crop-75-50"` would crop the image and make sure that the point at 75% across
and 50% down would be the focal point.

Rather than specifying the offsets, you may use `crop_focal` to use the asset's saved focal point.

A Statamic image asset can be assigned a percentage based focal point. You can do this by editing an
asset and defining the focal point using the UI. Or, you may add `focus: x-y` to the asset's metadata.

When using `crop_focal` and an asset doesn't have a focal point set, it will crop from the center.

Note: All Glide generated images are cropped at their focal point, unless you disable the _Auto Crop_
setting. This happens even when you don't specify a `fit` parameter. You may override this behavior
per-image/tag by specifying the `fit` parameter as described above.


## Vanity Filenames {#vanity-filenames}

The Glide URL is not really pretty, nor SEO friendly. The URL contains the ID of the image asset. ForÂ example: `/img/cbffccd0-ae6f-11e5-a837-0800200c9a66?w=20`.

Specifying `filename="bacon.jpg"` would change the URL to `/img/cbffccd0-ae6f-11e5-a837-0800200c9a66/bacon.jpg?w=20`.

The additional segment is purely cosmetic in terms of Statamic functionality (hence 'vanity'). However now if you were to right click and save the image, it would name it `bacon.jpg`. It would also be more recognizable to search engines as a photo of bacon rather than a photo of a `cbffccd0-ae6f-11e5-a837-0800200c9a66`.
