## Usage {#usage}

This tag has the same functionality as the [collection](collection) tag, with some differences.

The `entries` tag will attempt to get the entries based on a mount point of a page.

For example:

```
{{ entries from="/company/news" }}
   ...
{{ /entries }}
```

In this tag, Statamic will check the `/company/news` page for any mounted entry collections. If it has a mounted collection (with `mount: articles`, for example) the tag will get the entries in the `articles` collection.
